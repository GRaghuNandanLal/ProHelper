# ProHelper - Your On-Demand Service Solution 

The goal is to create a portal or platform that will connect service providers with customers or 
individuals seeking at-home services. The website primarily targets busy individuals, residents of 
cities or towns, and newcomers to urban areas who require housing related services. The 
platform aims to bridge the gap between customers and Service Providers who offer reliable and 
user-friendly services.
